Tour-Friend

Brief Description:
This an accompanying app to a board game that goes by the same name. As such,
its not exactly a game in itself, but somewhat of a guide for one.

Gameplay:
Pretty much a series of different screens connected together. 
The app keeps data, like points between the two teams.

Things to Add:

~Main Menu

Common Screen
-'back' button
-description of the screen
-one or two images
-'done' button

Select a place to go screen
(main screen, that the players revisit after each session)
-many choices for places to choose, as buttons
-points visible
-choose button instead of 'done'
-description and back as before

After Choosing a place (tourist)
-show video of said action (eg 'i want to go the airport) in sign-language
-'back' 'done' and description
-add a tourist icon next to the description
-place selection choice is visible on the upper right
(after this, the tourist attempts to imitate the video to the tourfriend)

Correct guessing/ 'what did the tourist ask you?' (tourfriend)
-two choices: one false and one correct
--video
--description
--number of choice icon
--'select' button
--'zoom in' button
---this magnifies the video along with the rest of the choice's buttons, so that it's more visible
----'zoom out' button replaces 'zoom in' and goes back to the video choice screen
(-place icon might be a mistake?)

WIP Point Award Screen
Depending on the above choice:
-correct adds two points
-false doesn't give anything

tourfriend gives directions screen
tourfrind confirm above (yes/no)

tourist go the the area explained by the tourfriend (yes/no)
(this is done on the board game; in the app, the tourist clicks whether the instructions got them to the correct place)
-award points

(the tourist is now on the location chosen before, eg the airport)

tourist asks question (similar to 'what did the tourist ak you')
tourfriend explains the question to themseleves
points awarded

tourfriend asks a question (doesn't choose) related to the situation above
this question includes two objects 
tourist chooses whatever they were questioned about
tourist replies to the above question. The two objects might be in conflict.
-objects coloured in pink
tourfriend chooses what he was questioned about
tourfriend gets shown a sign-language video to show the tourist
(the tourfriend gives a card to the tourist on the board game)
the tourist answers a two-video choice screen, with accompanying cards visible as well
after choice, the card gets shown to the tourist, asking a yes/no question whether it was the correct card

return to the place selection screen and repeat
-the places already visited are ticked off

Tings to Change:

'Image' of screengameobject should rather change to 'Content' Gameobject
-a more generic form is needed, as it is sometimes more than an image
--eg two images, a selection screen, a single video, two video choices and so on

also, more buttons than one in screengameobject?




Things to Consider:

View Updated Layouts before starting

Many Languages for the written texts
& Many (more) Sign Languages for the Videos
(Including Greek, English, French, Italian, Cypriot and possibly more)

the app could function as a sequence of screens

test 'primitive' form with one image and one button
-works ok, but...

Updating all screens might be a hassle in the above way
-prefab variants?
-or rather, one prefab, but update the descriptions, images etc
--prefab updating is buggy and dangerous!
-rather make a database eg excel, holding assosiate data?
--including description, content(/type?),button(s), type-of-screen?, numbers-of-content-objects/buttons?,next-screen?

keep in mind that there are many more screens than the ones shown
-eg one can choose different locations to go and different things to say

the top-left icon is a menu button?

selections with raycasts similar to the 'transaction scenes' in Canteen

video phrases choice screen
-select a phrase to show the corresponding video
--close the video and return. repeat if necessary

new game explanation to myself:
(after clicking new game on the menu)
Phase Zero (no interaction, no points given):
-welcome screens (a series of screens explaining what to do)
-choose where to go (select one location of many. Central screen of the game. The player returns frequently to this)
Phase One:
-*depending on the choice above* play video screen, show simple screen
-two video choices (the player selects a video)
-points award screen (+2 for win +0 for loss)
Phase Two:
-choose phrases and show corresponding videos screen
-video screen, choose continue(go above) or finish(go down)
-yes or no screen
-common screen
-yes or no screen
-points award
Phase Three:
-you're in *location chosen above* common screen
-choose between two videos
-confirmation
-common
-choose between two videos
-points award
Phase Four:
-common screen with video reply
-common screen
-two video choices
-points award
Pase Five:
-reply with two video choices
-confirmation common screen
-common screen
-two video choices
-award points
Phase Six:
-video common screen
-common screen
-two video choices
-yes/no ('is this the correct reply and card')
-award points
End of round. Go back to level select, cross out the chosen place and repeat until all places are visited.

all types of screens:
-common screen (description,image,confirmation button)
--one image
---one image, two buttons (yes/no) (either award points, or go to a previous screen)
--two images
--video
---video with two buttons (continue/finish)
-choose location screen
-choose two videos 
-points screen
--win/lose variants
-choose phrases (with videos) screen
note that descriptions are often accompanied by one or two icons, indicating current player (and) a card
location icon on the top-right/points text on location select
//-x-or more refined:
//-x-all screens have (description,content, button(s))


make a constructor for each type of the above screens
-x-make a general constructor
--make 'specialised' constructors within it
---they should be able to check the screen type and assign various data to it
----(keep an 'identity' string on screenobject script to check)
----a dictionary on screen types should be used
----string references to the ones already stored on lists and dictionaries can be used for input data

keep account of the number of steps needed to finish a round. 
 In some cases we need to return to a previous one

keep screens' numbers in a list, so that we can access them
-keep them as phases?

keep account of the 'content' of all screens
-this means keeping a list of corresponding descriptions and buttons etc in the same place
 so that we can have access to them all at the same time
--eg on a list of of 50 screens, the first has description as ['sample'] and button1 as ['sample2']
--a list of scriptable objects could do this
---non used elements for a current screen, such as videos can be ignored

Languages (Sign): English,Greek,Cyptriot,Belgian,French,Italian
Languages (Written): English, Greek, French, Italian, Belgian(Two Languages?)

Languages can be used in a combintaion of Written-Language AND Sign-Language
eg 
See Alexandros' conversation comments for advice on

'next' button generating
-keep 'next buttons' as prefabs

make a script that handles different screen resolutions
