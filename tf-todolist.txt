Tour-Friend

Brief Description:
This an accompanying app to a board game that goes by the same name. As such,
its not exactly a game in itself, but somewhat of a guide for one.

Gameplay:
Pretty much a series of different screens connected together. 
The app keeps data, like points between the two teams.

Things to Add:

Main Menu

//Common Screen//-'back' button//-description of the screen//-one or two images//-'done' button

Select a place to go screen
(main screen, that the players revisit after each session)
-many choices for places to choose, as buttons
-points visible
-choose button instead of 'done'
-description and back as before

After Choosing a place (tourist)
-show video of said action (eg 'i want to go the airport) in sign-language
-'back' 'done' and description
-add a tourist icon next to the description
-place selection choice is visible on the upper right
(after this, the tourist attempts to imitate the video to the tourfriend)

Correct guessing/ 'what did the tourist ask you?' (tourfriend)
-two choices: one false and one correct
--video
--description
--number of choice icon
--'select' button
--'zoom in' button
---this magnifies the video along with the rest of the choice's buttons, so that it's more visible
----'zoom out' button replaces 'zoom in' and goes back to the video choice screen
(-place icon might be a mistake?)

WIP Point Award Screen
Depending on the above choice:
-correct adds two points
-false doesn't give anything

tourfriend gives directions screen
tourfrind confirm above (yes/no)

tourist go the the area explained by the tourfriend (yes/no)
(this is done on the board game; in the app, the tourist clicks whether the instructions got them to the correct place)
-award points

(the tourist is now on the location chosen before, eg the airport)

tourist asks question (similar to 'what did the tourist ak you')
tourfriend explains the question to themseleves
points awarded

tourfriend asks a question (doesn't choose) related to the situation above
this question includes two objects 
tourist chooses whatever they were questioned about
tourist replies to the above question. The two objects might be in conflict.
-objects coloured in pink
tourfriend chooses what he was questioned about
tourfriend gets shown a sign-language video to show the tourist
(the tourfriend gives a card to the tourist on the board game)
the tourist answers a two-video choice screen, with accompanying cards visible as well
after choice, the card gets shown to the tourist, asking a yes/no question whether it was the correct card

return to the place selection screen and repeat
-the places already visited are ticked off

Tings to Change:

'Image' of screengameobject should rather change to 'Content' Gameobject
-a more generic form is needed, as it is sometimes more than an image
--eg two images, a selection screen, a single video, two video choices and so on

also, more buttons than one in screengameobject?




Things to Consider:

View Updated Layouts before starting

Many Languages for the written texts
& Many (more) Sign Languages for the Videos
(Including Greek, English, French, Italian, Cypriot and possibly more)

the app could function as a sequence of screens

test 'primitive' form with one image and one button
-works ok, but...

Updating all screens might be a hassle in the above way
-prefab variants?
-or rather, one prefab, but update the descriptions, images etc
--prefab updating is buggy and dangerous!
-rather make a database eg excel, holding assosiate data?
--including description, content(/type?),button(s), type-of-screen?, numbers-of-content-objects/buttons?,next-screen?

keep in mind that there are many more screens than the ones shown
-eg one can choose different locations to go and different things to say

the top-left icon is a menu button?

selections with raycasts similar to the 'transaction scenes' in Canteen

video phrases choice screen
-select a phrase to show the corresponding video
--close the video and return. repeat if necessary

new game explanation to myself:
(after clicking new game on the menu)
Phase Zero (no interaction, no points given):
-welcome screens (a series of screens explaining what to do)
-choose where to go (select one location of many. Central screen of the game. The player returns frequently to this)
Phase One:
-*depending on the choice above* play video screen, show simple screen
-two video choices (the player selects a video)
-points award screen (+2 for win +0 for loss)
Phase Two:
-choose phrases and show corresponding videos screen
-video screen, choose continue(go above) or finish(go down)
-yes or no screen
-common screen
-yes or no screen
-points award
Phase Three:
-you're in *location chosen above* common screen
-choose between two videos
-confirmation
-common
-choose between two videos
-points award
Phase Four:
-common screen with video reply
-common screen
-two video choices
-points award
Pase Five:
-reply with two video choices
-confirmation common screen
-common screen
-two video choices
-award points
Phase Six:
-video common screen
-common screen
-two video choices
-yes/no ('is this the correct reply and card')
-award points
End of round. Go back to level select, cross out the chosen place and repeat until all places are visited.

all types of screens:
//-common screen (description,image,confirmation button)
//--one image
---one image, two buttons (yes/no) (either award points, or go to a previous screen)
//--two images
//--video
---video with two buttons (continue/finish)
-choose location screen
-choose two videos 
//-points screen
//--win/lose variants
-choose phrases (with videos) screen
note that descriptions are often accompanied by one or two icons, indicating current player (and) a card
location icon on the top-right/points text on location select
//-x-or more refined:
//-x-all screens have (description,content, button(s))


make a constructor for each type of the above screens
-x-make a general constructor
--make 'specialised' constructors within it
---they should be able to check the screen type and assign various data to it
----(keep an 'identity' string on screenobject script to check)
----a dictionary on screen types should be used
----string references to the ones already stored on lists and dictionaries can be used for input data

keep account of the number of steps needed to finish a round. 
 In some cases we need to return to a previous one

keep screens' numbers in a list, so that we can access them
-keep them as phases?

keep account of the 'content' of all screens
-this means keeping a list of corresponding descriptions and buttons etc in the same place
 so that we can have access to them all at the same time
--eg on a list of of 50 screens, the first has description as ['sample'] and button1 as ['sample2']
--a list of scriptable objects could do this
---non used elements for a current screen, such as videos can be ignored

Languages (Sign): English,Greek,Cyptriot,Belgian,French,Italian
Languages (Written): English, Greek, French, Italian, Belgian(Two Languages?)

Languages can be used in a combintaion of Written-Language AND Sign-Language
eg 
See Alexandros' conversation comments for advice on

'next' button generating
-keep 'next buttons' as prefabs

make a script that handles different screen resolutions
-make also a simple "set everything to original screen ratio"
--looks tiny on other resolutions eg 1920/1080
---enlarge it?
//--two videos screen gets messed up video boxes

finish two vidoes constructor

improve video choice, with its SO!

see Alexandros' feedback on access GameObject children: first use "Find", and when we finish the prefab, we can use "GetChild"

Interactivity:
-Select Place
--load place specific data on questions, images etc
-Select from Two Videos
--Bring up points award
---Points++ if correct
---No points if false
-
-End of round
--go back to place select
---keep all data
---mark out visited places

buggy correct/wrong answer
-handled between gamemaster, videoobjects and pointsscript

menu
-5 sign languages 
-4 written languages 
-start button

clean up this file!

the map is randomised

check dialogues excel

Alexandros suggests:
-textmeshpro for texts
-remove 'gameobjects'
--prefabs should be 'canvas' objects
---(canvas objets can be handled automatically by the app)
-target the smallest screen resolution available (for mobile)

two videos issues:
-incorrect video assignment: both videos show the same one
--check its handling on canteen
-the video that is supposed to be the correct one, shows the wrong answer
 and vice versa!

 new issues:
 -place select's green button should be disabled before clicking on airport (like in canteen)
 -'continue' button on onevideo-twochoices should take us one screen back
 -constructor for oneimage-twochoices with similar functionality to the above
 -better handling of screen sequence needed
 --the game should be notified when a screen has the ability to change its route
 ---examples include correct/false questions, or replay video etc

 -move pawn screen
 --keeps previously generated map
 --(its design is under construction and subject to change)
 -randomised map:
 --once in the game, assign all nine of its images in random positions and keep them that way
 ---make a dictionary(?)

 bug between phrase select-videoselect-imageselect
 -on video and image s constructors only one button has a constructor
 --add for the other one, plus reduce currentscreen, since both add one to it
 --video gets constructed twice on 'continue' (left button, first time)?

 placeselect
 -re-enable raycasts on placeselect images
 -write code for disabled places (ones that we've already visited)

 map
 -randomise properly, exclusively from images already existing (ie not multiple randoms of one piture)
 -keep the map as is when reappearring (don't reinitialise it)
 -integrate it to the game

rounds repeat themseleves somewhat
-eg screens 6,7 etc
-points (in pages 23-24,31-32,37-38,44-45,50-51)
-give device to tourfriend (13,29,42)
-give device to tourist (21,34,47)
rest of screens
-pawn yes/no(22)
-two images(25)
-two videos(26,30,35,39,43,48)
-one video(28,33,41,46)
-one image two answers(49)

two options issues:
-one image two choices
--fix functioning for both buttons (for choices after phrase select)
-two videos
--false answer continues to the next screen
--correct bugs up next constructor screen
---videos working 'correctly': 8,17
//---videos bugging: 20,24,26,29,33
-last video's 'correct' answer bugs up last two-options picture
--with false constructor
--false texts, let alone description
--red button makes everything disappear!
--'false' does create it correctly

print screen number?

//exit button

//fix map getting destroyed, instead of kept

copy text from SOs to gamemaster's words_en (to preapare for Greek plus more translations)
-check canteen code for proper handling
videos should work similarly

remove unneeded variables on SOs

different routes keep the same seriies of gameobject prefabs, but change their content on their constructors?
-eg the 'taxi' option has videos and cards and questions etc just like the 'airport' one
-the constructors should be able to call different SOs depending on the situation

pawn screen 
(appears after the select phrase/video screens, and asks from us to move the pawn to the position we believe we were led to )
-map with hidden locations
//--clicking on one square reveals its location underneath it
--the pawn sjould be on the last visited location
//---if we have visited multiple places they should be open as well?
//---(use raycasts, instatiate and destroy the proper objects)

i came up with some solutions :
-Languages can be handled from within the constructor of each screen, with a function that:
--either leaves its content as-is if it's already in English
--or calls the dictionary, if it's in any other language
--(the same process can be called for videos, too)
-Different routes canbe handled with different lists of Screen ScriptableObjects
--eg we already have one (pretty much) for airport actions, we can replace it with one with taxi actions and so on, after we choose our preffered location
---(this counts for screens from after location-select. (we should allow its constructor to handle more than one route as well)

what to do with pawn
//-initial version:
//--raycast hits blank image and disables it
//--keep this imageObject in a variable
//--raycast hits another image
//---enable previously kept, and assign the new one as kept
//-later on:
//--reveal visited places and info point at start
//eg we have been to the airport, and so we can reveal its location at start
//better check this with the images underneath, so that they are the exact same images of the locations

//test both map and pawnmap with placeholder images
//-as previously stated, we need a randomised map with ALL nine locations
//-the pawnmap should, at first, reveal ONLY the tile with the InfoPoint icon beneath it

place select issues:
//-'disable' images after being selected at the start()
//--make them darker as well?
-make a more formal constructor for different routes?

//replace second map with mappawn

some of the map screens look small

add functionality to the lense button
-both magnification and shrinking

//green rectangles around selection
//-button should add a green rectangle behind it, with an added size to its dimensions (ie +10y, +10x to its original size)

select phrase screen's next videos
-on 'constructor decider' a special case should be added, checking on one-video if the previous screen was a phrase-select
-phrase-select buttons should hold information on which video should be called

//try a scale-and-move approach to magnifying lense
//-keep somewhere the prefab's parameters
//-scale and mmove to the center
//-revert to the original

lense
//-hide second box when zoomed-in
//--override canvas
-zoomed video should start playing
--and stop when zoomed out
--plays video on both choice objects?

back button
//-enable again
//-change approach?
//--keeping the current screen to be re-initiated by pressing the button?
//---somewhat similar to the save map functions
-disable when not needed (eg placeSelect,points,choices etc)
-fix bugs
--needs to be pressed twice on some screens
